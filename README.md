# R Codes corresponding to the submission titled "Robust and Automatic Data Clustering: Dirichlet Process meets Median-of-Means"

All the necessary numerical computations were run on an Intel Core i3-7020U CPU (2.30GHz, 2.30 GHz) with 2 cores and 4GB RAM.

**Instructions to run DP-MoM, our proposed method, on any computer with R:**
- Open the `DP-MoM-R-Codes.Rproj` file, preferably in RStudio.
- Open the file `demo.py`.
- Open `methods.R`, and install the required packages if not already installed.
- Call `DP.MoM.optimised(data)` where data is character string containing the name of the dataset (Please refer to the datasets folder within the R Project).
